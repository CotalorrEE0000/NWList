NWList is a small python program that can differ english words from txt.

I use it for my english learning while i have a new word note and another note. 
I have to keep one notebook only record word once.


In New Text Document.txt

try using $  for paragraph, and ZZZ to spilt the txt.
every , will identify each word or quote.
output is also a .txt file which will tell you what word is new

In Abstracted Document.txt
"The new word list:
...
...
Totally of *** words."

I have given two file example "Abstracted Document.txt" and "New Text Document.txt"
just replace it information by copy your word list!

try use python in shell to run it.
